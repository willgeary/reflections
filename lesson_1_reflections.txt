Viewing a diff helped me compare two files.
By viewing this comparison, I could identify differences.
By viewing the differences, I could audit which ones were intentional.

Having access to the history of a file will help identify future bugs.

Manually choosing when to commit makes it easier to audit later.

Coding files are interdependent so it makes sense to allow saving multiple files in one commit.

1. git log to see the log of commits. scroll down using down arrow
2. git diff firstid secondid to see differences between commits

Git will make me more confident in coding because I can try things and recover if I break anything.

I want to use Git so I can share my work.

Creating a repository
$ git init # to initialize empty Git repository in current working directory
$ git log
$ git status
